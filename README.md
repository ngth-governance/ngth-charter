# NGTH Charter

This repository contains the charter and non-negotiable principles of the  
**National Governance Transparency Hub (NGTH)** and its core operational platform,  
the **Public Accountability & Performance Platform (PAPP)**.

NGTH is a **public-interest governance transparency infrastructure**, designed to ensure that
government governance is **visible, auditable, and comparable**, and that this visibility
is maintained **across political cycles**.

---

## Purpose

Modern democratic systems debate policy publicly and approve budgets formally,  
yet governance outcomes are often fragmented, delayed, or difficult for the public
to verify.

NGTH exists to address this structural gap.

It does **not** evaluate political intent or prescribe policy.  
It ensures that **governance performance can be seen, examined, and traced responsibly**.

---

## What This Repository Is

This repository serves as the **constitutional reference** for NGTH.

It defines:
- Institutional purpose and scope  
- Non-negotiable transparency and accountability principles  
- Governance boundaries and responsibility attribution  
- Explicit limits on AI and software agents  
- The dual-name structure of NGTH and PAPP  

The documents in this repository are intended to be:
- Stable over time  
- Independent of political leadership  
- Applicable across jurisdictions  

---

## What This Repository Is Not

This repository does **not**:
- Advocate for any political party or ideology  
- Propose or endorse specific policies  
- Replace democratic or legal decision-making  
- Contain operational or production code  

NGTH provides **infrastructure for transparency**, not instructions for governance.

---

## Dual-Name Structure

NGTH adopts a dual-name institutional structure to balance long-term continuity
with present-day accountability.

- **National Governance Transparency Hub (NGTH)**  
  The long-term, neutral, public-interest governance transparency infrastructure.

- **Public Accountability & Performance Platform (PAPP)**  
  The core public-facing platform that makes government performance and
  responsibility visible and traceable.

This structure allows the infrastructure to remain politically neutral,
while enabling clear accountability in practice.

---

## Human Authority and AI Boundaries

NGTH and PAPP may use AI or software agents **only as assistive tools**.

AI may support:
- Monitoring and early warning  
- Explanation of indicators and methods  
- Workflow tracking  
- Scenario simulation  

AI may **not**:
- Make policy or executive decisions  
- Modify governance rules or thresholds  
- Close or resolve accountability cases  
- Generate political or persuasive content  

All authority remains with human actors operating under democratic
and legal frameworks.

## Status

This repository is intentionally conservative and foundational.

Changes are expected to be infrequent and carefully reviewed, as this charter
forms the basis for all current and future NGTH-related work.
