# NGTH Charter

The National Governance Transparency Hub (NGTH) is a public-interest governance infrastructure.

This charter defines the non-negotiable principles, governance boundaries, and institutional purpose of NGTH and its core operational platform, the Public Accountability & Performance Platform (PAPP).

NGTH exists to ensure that governance processes are:
- Visible to the public
- Auditable by independent institutions
- Comparable across jurisdictions
- Continuous across political cycles

This repository serves as the constitutional reference for NGTH.
