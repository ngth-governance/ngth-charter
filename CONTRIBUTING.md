## How to Contribute

At the current stage, contributions are handled by the NGTH Steward(s).

If you wish to suggest a change:

2. Contact the project maintainers through the organization’s public channels

As the project matures, a more formal contribution and review process
may be introduced.

## Review Philosophy

All proposed changes are evaluated against the following criteria:

- Does the change preserve political neutrality?
- Does it strengthen public trust?
- Does it maintain long-term institutional integrity?
- Does it avoid introducing operational or ideological bias?

Clarity and restraint are valued over volume or speed.
