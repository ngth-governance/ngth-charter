# AI and Agent Boundaries

NGTH and PAPP may use AI and software agents strictly as assistive tools.

## AI is permitted to:
- Monitor indicators and detect anomalies
- Explain metrics and methodologies
- Support workflow tracking
- Simulate scenarios for human decision-makers

## AI is explicitly prohibited from:
- Making policy or executive decisions
- Altering KPI definitions or thresholds
- Closing governance cases
- Generating political or persuasive content

All decision authority remains with human actors under democratic and legal frameworks.
