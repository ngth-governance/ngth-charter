# Dual-Name Structure

NGTH adopts a dual-name institutional structure to balance long-term national continuity and present-day operational effectiveness.

## Umbrella Infrastructure
**National Governance Transparency Hub (NGTH)**  
A permanent, neutral, public-interest governance transparency infrastructure.

## Core Operational Platform
**Public Accountability & Performance Platform (PAPP)**  
The primary public-facing platform that makes government performance and responsibility visible.

This structure ensures:
- Cross-party neutrality at the infrastructure level
- Practical accountability and performance visibility at the operational level
- Immunity from political cycles while remaining publicly relevant
