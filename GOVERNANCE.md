# Governance

This document defines how changes to the NGTH Charter repository are managed.

The purpose of this governance model is to ensure that the foundational
principles of the National Governance Transparency Hub (NGTH) remain
stable, credible, and independent over time.

---

## Scope

This governance model applies **only** to this repository (`ngth-charter`).

The documents in this repository define the non-negotiable institutional
principles of NGTH and its core platform, PAPP.

As such, this repository is intentionally conservative.

---

## Authority

Final authority over this repository rests with the **NGTH Steward(s)**.

Stewards are responsible for:
- Preserving the integrity of the charter
- Ensuring political neutrality
- Protecting public-interest intent
- Maintaining consistency across documents

Stewardship is an institutional role, not a personal entitlement.

---

## Change Policy

Changes to this repository are expected to be **rare**.

Permissible changes include:
- Clarifications of language
- Corrections of factual or typographical errors
- Additions that strengthen transparency or accountability principles
- Structural improvements that do not alter intent

The following are **not permitted**:
- Introduction of political positions or advocacy
- Policy prescriptions or operational directives
- Dilution of transparency, accountability, or auditability principles
- Expansion of AI or agent authority beyond assistive roles

---

## Review Process

At the current stage:
- Changes may be committed directly to the main branch by an NGTH Steward.

As the project matures:
- A formal review or advisory process may be introduced
- External review by academic or civic institutions may be invited

Any future process will prioritize independence and public trust over speed.

---

## Transparency

All changes to this repository are publicly visible.

Commit history serves as a permanent audit trail of how NGTH’s foundational
principles evolve over time.

---

## Relationship to Other Repositories

This repository sits above all other NGTH-related repositories.

If any conflict arises between this repository and other documentation,
the principles defined here **prevail**.

---

## Amendments

This governance model may itself be amended only under the same conservative
standards defined above.

Amendments must strengthen, not weaken, institutional integrity.
